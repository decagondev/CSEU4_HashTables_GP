# lets make a simple hash function that takes in an abitary string and output the bytes of that string


# first lets see what output we get when iterating over the string

def my_hash(s):
    pass

# so how can we turn each char in to a number?
# let's make a plan and explore this

def my_hash2(s):
    pass


# now one ster further lets thing of a deterministic way to make a number to represent the entire string

def my_hash3(s):
    pass


print(my_hash("Hello")) 
print(my_hash2("Hello")) 
print(my_hash3("Hello"))
print(my_hash3("Hello"))
print(my_hash3("Hello"))
print(my_hash3("World"))
print(my_hash3("World"))
print(my_hash3("World"))
