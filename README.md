# Hash Tables

## The Problem With Arrays

What is the problem we are trying to solve?
- With a list / array it is `O(n)` to search.

```python
arr = ["lorem", "ipsum", "dolor", "sit", "amet", "consectetur", "adipiscing", "elit" ]
#        0         1        2       3      4           5              6          7    
```


## Hash Functions

What is a hash function?


## Map the hash!

The numbers that we have generated could get fairly large and we need a way to turn them in to an index of a list / array.

Think of ways to do this geven a finite size of a list to turn the number in to one clamped to a range
